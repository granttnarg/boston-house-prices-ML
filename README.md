# Boston House Princes - ML Learning Project

## Overview

## Dataset

## Project Structure

### Planned Analysis Steps

- Data Collection & Investigation
- Data Cleaning pt 1 (only dealing with zero values)
- Train/Test split - Separate our Xtrain Xtest and Ytrain Ytest
- Data Visualization (look for patterns and further cleaning, outliers, fillin data possibilities)
- Data Cleaning pt 2 (filling in data values or adjusting outliers)
- Data Visualization (final check are we happy with our clean data)
- Exploratory Analysis (Correlations, trying to decide on features)
- Feature engineering - decide on best features and/or make new features if needed
- Model building
  - Set a baseline with linear regression
- Cross validate
- Iterate on Model - try some different models or adjust features to see if we can get a better outcome
- Pipeline - After our first setup we can then refactor some of our cleaning and feature engineering logic into a pipeline
